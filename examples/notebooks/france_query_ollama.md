### Testing Ollama

> Thank @[yeahdongcn](https://github.com/yeahdongcn) for supporting Ollama and providing the following example! (Reference: [Support Ollama](https://github.com/octotools/octotools/pull/44))

Install dependicies:

```sh
uv pip install -e .
uv run python
```

Input:

```python
from octotools.solver import construct_solver
llm_engine_name = "ollama-qwen3:latest" # Just using "ollama-qwen3" will also work
# ollama engine will automatically pull the model if not found locally
solver = construct_solver(llm_engine_name=llm_engine_name, verbose=True)
output = solver.solve("What is the capital of France?")
```

Output:

```sh
root@0-4-35-gpu-mi300x1-192gb-devcloud-atl1:~/octotools# uv run python
Python 3.12.3 (main, Jun 18 2025, 17:59:45) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux

==> 🎯 Step 1: Action Prediction (Wikipedia_Knowledge_Searcher_Tool)

[Context]: No previous steps have been taken. The query is asking for the capital of France.
[Sub Goal]: Search Wikipedia for information about the capital of France
[Tool]: Wikipedia_Knowledge_Searcher_Tool
[Time]: 32.11s

==> 📝 Step 1: Command Generation (Wikipedia_Knowledge_Searcher_Tool)

[Analysis]: The query is asking for the capital of France. The sub-goal is to search Wikipedia for this information. The selected tool is Wikipedia_Knowledge_Searcher_Tool, which requires a 'query' parameter of type string. Since there are no previous steps, we can directly use the query 'capital of France' as the input to the tool.
[Explanation]: The command uses the Wikipedia_Knowledge_Searcher_Tool to search for the query 'capital of France'. The input parameter 'query' is set to 'capital of France' to retrieve the relevant information from Wikipedia.
[Command]: execution = tool.execute(query="capital of France")
[Time]: 12.31s

Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants to know the capital of France. The image is empty, so I don't need to consider that. The actions taken involve using the Wikipedia Knowledge Searcher Tool. Let me look at the results from that tool.

The search results list several entries, but the most relevant one is the first result, which mentions that Paris has been the capital since 1944. The extracted text gives a detailed chronology of France's capitals. It lists various cities like Tournai, Soissons, Laon, and Paris, among others. The key point here is that Paris is the current capital, starting from 1944 after being liberated.

Wait, but the user's query is straightforward. They just want the current capital. The answer is clearly Paris. The tool's result explicitly states that Paris has been the capital since 1944. The detailed chronology shows that Paris has been the capital multiple times, most recently from 1594–1682, then Versailles, then back to Paris until 1871, and then again after some provisional seats. The last entry says that after 1944, Paris became the capital again.

So the steps are: used Wikipedia tool to search for 'capital of France', got a list, and the first result's extracted text confirms Paris as the current capital. The answer should be Paris. The user might not need the entire history, but the key finding is that Paris is the current capital.

I need to structure the answer according to the sections provided. The summary should state that the query was about France's capital, and the tool found that Paris is the answer. The detailed analysis should explain the tool used, the search process, and the result. Key findings would include Paris being the current capital since 1944. The answer is straightforward. Additional insights could mention the historical capitals, but since the query is about the current one, maybe not necessary. The conclusion reinforces that Paris is the correct answer.

I should make sure that each section is covered, but keep it concise. The user might be testing if I can extract the correct answer from the given tool results. No conflicting information here. All good.
