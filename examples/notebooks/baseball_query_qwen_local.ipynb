      "   - **Explanation**: This tool can be used to analyze the image and count the baseballs. By providing a clear prompt about counting objects, the tool will generate a response indicating the number of baseballs present in the image.\n",
      "   - **Limitations**: The tool may not always detect all objects accurately, especially if they are very small or have similar colors to the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Object_Detector_Tool**\n",
      "   - **Explanation**: This tool can be used to detect and count individual baseballs in the image. By specifying the labels \"baseball,\" the tool will identify and count each baseball.\n",
      "   - **Limitations**: The model may struggle with small objects or objects with limited attributes. Additionally, the detection accuracy can vary based on the input image and associated labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Considerations\n",
      "- **Image Quality**: Ensure the image is clear and free from noise or distortion, as these can affect object detection accuracy.\n",
      "- **Prompt Clarity**: The prompt provided to the Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool should be clear and specific, such as \"Count the number of baseballs in the image.\"\n",
      "- **Verification**: After obtaining the count from the tool, manually verify the result to ensure accuracy, especially if the tool's detection accuracy is low.\n",
      "\n",
      "By utilizing the Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool with a clear prompt and the Object_Detector_Tool, we can effectively address the query of counting the number of baseballs in the image.\n",
